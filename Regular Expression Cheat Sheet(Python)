1. Import the module 're' for regular expression in python3

2. Character classes :
  \d    Any numeric digit from 0 to 9
  \D    Any character that is not a numeric digit from 0 to 9
  \w    Any letter,numeric digit, or the underscore character
  \W    Any character that is not a letter, numeric digit or underscore character
  \s    Any space,tab, or newline character
  \S    Any character that is not a space,tab, or a newline character


3. RegEx Objects :
  pr = re.compile(r'\d\d\d-\d\d\d')
    Here 'pr' is a regex object
    Using 'r' in compile() ensures that raw strings are passed

4. Matching RegEx Objects :
  A regEx object's search() method searches for the string and returns an object
  of type 'Match'
  Match objects have a group(), that returns the actual text.
  If pattern is not found, search() returns None.

5. Grouping :
  We can group using parentheses. Group(1) is the first group. Using group(0),
  or group() will return the entire matched text.

  groups() will return all the groups together as a tuple for multiple values.
  We can unpack it using multiple assignment
  Example :
            areaCode, mainNumber = mo.groups()

  For using parentheses as part of the pattern, we can use the escape characters
  \( and \)

6. Matching multiple groups with pipe :
  Using the '|' character we can match many expressions at once. The first
  occurence is returned as the Match object.
  We can use parentheses to mention prefix only once
  Example:
          postRegex = re.compile(r'Post(office|man)')
